Tekla Structures is a software that enables architects, engineers, contractors, and fabricators to create and manage 3D models of complex structures. Tekla Structures supports various types of structures, such as buildings, bridges, industrial plants, stadiums, and offshore structures. Tekla Structures also allows users to generate 2D drawings, reports, and schedules from the 3D models.

Tekla Structures 18.1 is a version of the software that was released in 2012. It introduced several new features and improvements, such as:
 
- Enhanced interoperability with other software, such as Autodesk Revit, Bentley Systems MicroStation, and Intergraph SmartPlant 3D.
- Improved performance and stability of the software.
- New tools and options for modeling concrete structures, such as slabs, walls, columns, beams, and foundations.
- New tools and options for modeling steel structures, such as connections, bolts, welds, plates, and profiles.
- New tools and options for modeling reinforcement bars, meshes, and stirrups.
- New tools and options for creating custom components and macros.
- New tools and options for managing changes and revisions in the models.
- New tools and options for creating animations and renderings of the models.

Tekla Structures 18.1 requires a 64-bit operating system and a license key to run. Some users may also need to install a patch file to fix some bugs or errors in the software. The patch file is named `tekla.structures.18.1.64-bit-patch.epub` and can be downloaded from various online sources[^2^] [^3^] [^4^]. However, users should be careful when downloading and installing the patch file, as it may contain malicious code or viruses that can harm their computers[^2^]. Users should always scan the patch file with an anti-virus software before running it.

Tekla Structures is a powerful and versatile software that can be used to model various types of structures with different materials, shapes, and sizes. Some examples of structures modeled with Tekla Structures are:

- The Burj Khalifa in Dubai, UAE: The tallest building in the world, with a height of 828 meters and 163 floors. Tekla Structures was used to model the complex steel structure of the building, including the spire, the cladding, and the mechanical floors.
- The National Stadium in Beijing, China: The main venue for the 2008 Olympic Games, with a capacity of 91,000 spectators. Tekla Structures was used to model the unique steel structure of the stadium, which resembles a bird's nest.
- The London Eye in London, UK: The largest observation wheel in the world, with a diameter of 120 meters and 32 capsules. Tekla Structures was used to model the steel structure of the wheel, including the hub, the spokes, and the rim.
- The Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: The tallest twin towers in the world, with a height of 452 meters and 88 floors. Tekla Structures was used to model the steel structure of the towers, including the skybridge, the spires, and the outriggers.
- The Eiffel Tower in Paris, France: The most iconic landmark of Paris, with a height of 324 meters and three levels. Tekla Structures was used to model the wrought iron structure of the tower, including the legs, the arches, and the lattice.

These are just some of the many examples of structures modeled with Tekla Structures. You can find more examples on the Tekla Structures website[^1^] or on the Tekla User Assistance site.
