If you are one of those users who are facing this issue, don't worry. In this article, we will show you some possible solutions to fix the no supported audio device found error in Virtua Tennis 4. Follow the steps below and hopefully you will be able to play the game without any problems.
 
## Solution 1: Update Your Sound Card Drivers
 
One of the most common causes of the no supported audio device found error in Virtua Tennis 4 is outdated or incompatible sound card drivers. Your sound card drivers are responsible for communicating with your audio devices and enabling them to work properly with your PC. If your drivers are corrupted, missing, or outdated, they may not be able to recognize your audio devices and cause the error.
 
To update your sound card drivers, you can use a reliable driver updater tool that can automatically scan your PC for any driver issues and update them with the latest versions. Alternatively, you can manually update your drivers by following these steps:
 
1. Press Windows + R keys to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type devmgmt.msc and click OK to open the Device Manager.
3. Expand the Sound, video and game controllers category and right-click on your sound card device.
4. Select Update driver from the context menu and choose Search automatically for updated driver software.
5. Wait for Windows to search for and install the best available driver for your device.
6. Restart your PC and check if the error is resolved.

## Solution 2: Install DirectX 9
 
Another possible reason why you may encounter the no supported audio device found error in Virtua Tennis 4 is that your PC does not have DirectX 9 installed. DirectX 9 is a software component that is required by many games and applications to run smoothly on Windows. Even if you have a newer version of DirectX installed, such as DirectX 11 or 12, you may still need DirectX 9 for some older games like Virtua Tennis 4.

## Solution 3: Disable Your Sound Card Temporarily

1. Open the Device Manager as described in Solution 1.
2. Right-click on your sound card device and select Disable device from the context menu.
3. Click Yes to confirm your action and close the Device Manager.
4. Launch Virtua Tennis 4 and check if the error is gone.
5. After playing the game, enable your sound card again by following the same steps but selecting Enable device instead of Disable device.
