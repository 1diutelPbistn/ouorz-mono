In this article, we will show you how to use your Activation Code or Download Access Code to activate Cubase 7 with a 64 bit system. We will also explain what to do if you need to reactivate your license on a new computer or after reinstalling your operating system.
 
## What is an Activation Code and a Download Access Code?
 
An Activation Code is a 32-digit code that you need to enter in the eLicenser Control Center (eLCC) software to download and store your license on your computer or a USB-eLicenser (dongle). You can only use an Activation Code once. If you have already used it, you will need to perform a reactivation to get a new one.
 
A Download Access Code is a 20-digit code that you need to redeem in the Steinberg Download Assistant (SDA) software to download your Cubase 7 installer and generate an Activation Code automatically. You can only redeem a Download Access Code once. If you have already redeemed it, you will need to log in to your MySteinberg account to access your Activation Code.
