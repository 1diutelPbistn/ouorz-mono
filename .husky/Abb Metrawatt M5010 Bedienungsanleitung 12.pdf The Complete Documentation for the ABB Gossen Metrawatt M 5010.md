The ABB Metrawatt M5010 is a high-precision digital multimeter that can measure various electrical quantities, such as voltage, current, resistance, frequency, capacitance, and temperature. It also has an automatic blocking system (ABS) that prevents incorrect connections and selections of measuring quantities[^2^]. This article will guide you on how to use the ABB Metrawatt M5010 digital multimeter and provide you with a link to download the user manual in PDF format.

- The multimeter itself
- Two measurement cables with banana plugs and test probes
- A thermocouple for temperature measurement (optional)
- A power supply or batteries for the multimeter
- A device or circuit that you want to measure

## How to Connect the Multimeter
 
Before you connect the multimeter to the device or circuit that you want to measure, make sure that the multimeter is turned off and that the device or circuit is disconnected from any power source. Then follow these steps:

1. Insert the red measurement cable into the red connector socket on the multimeter marked with "V/Î©/Hz". Insert the black measurement cable into the black connector socket marked with "COM".
2. Attach the test probes to the other ends of the measurement cables. The red test probe is positive and the black test probe is negative.
3. If you want to measure temperature, insert the thermocouple into the yellow connector socket on the multimeter marked with "TEMP". The thermocouple has two wires: one red and one blue. The red wire is positive and the blue wire is negative.
4. Connect the power supply or batteries to the multimeter according to the instructions in the user manual.
5. Turn on the multimeter by pressing the "ON/OFF" button.

## How to Select a Measuring Quantity
 
The ABB Metrawatt M5010 digital multimeter has a rotary switch that allows you to select different measuring quantities. The rotary switch has 12 positions, each marked with a symbol and a unit. The symbols and units are as follows:

| Symbol | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

| V~ | Volt AC | Alternating voltage |

| V= | Volt DC | Direct voltage |

| mV= | Milivolt DC | Direct voltage in millivolts |
