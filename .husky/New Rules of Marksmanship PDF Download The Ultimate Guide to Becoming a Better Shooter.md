One of the main advantages of The New Rules of Marksmanship PDF is that it teaches you how to practice dry fire training. Dry fire training is the act of releasing the firing pin on an unloaded chamber of a firearm, simulating the motion of firing without live ammunition. Dry fire training has many benefits for shooters of all levels, such as:
 
- It is less expensive than live fire training. You don't need to buy ammo or pay range fees to practice dry fire. You can save money and time by dry firing at home or anywhere else where it is safe and legal.
- It helps in improving trigger control. Trigger control is one of the most important skills for accurate shooting. By dry firing, you can focus on pressing the trigger smoothly and consistently, without disturbing the sight picture or flinching from recoil.
- It is safer than live fire training. Dry fire training eliminates the risk of accidental discharge, injury, or damage caused by live ammunition. You can practice with confidence and peace of mind, knowing that your gun is empty and safe.
- There are no restrictions. You can dry fire any time, any place, and as often as you want. You don't need to worry about weather, noise, or availability of a shooting range. You can also practice different scenarios, positions, and techniques that may not be possible or practical with live fire.
- You can practice practically anywhere. You can dry fire in your living room, bedroom, basement, backyard, or anywhere else where you have enough space and privacy. You just need a safe direction, a target, and a snap cap or dummy round to protect your firing pin.

Dry fire training is a proven and effective way to improve your shooting skills and confidence. However, it is not a substitute for live fire training. You still need to practice with live ammo periodically to verify your results and maintain your proficiency. The New Rules of Marksmanship PDF will help you balance your dry fire and live fire training for optimal performance.
