If you are a fan of classic racing games like Need for Speed and Fast and Furious, you might want to check out Race for Tuning, a new PC racing game that lets you buy and customize cars, compete in legal and illegal races, and build your car piece by piece in first person mode. Race for Tuning is developed and published by A. Strazhev and was released on Steam on April 19, 2019[^1^].
 
Race for Tuning features 13 legendary cars that you can modify with over 30 parts, including engines, body kits, spoilers, rims, neon, nitrous, and more. You can assemble and disassemble your car in your garage or at the tuning store, and move parts from one car to another. You can also switch between first person and third person views to admire your ride from different angles.

The game also offers an open world mode where you can explore a small city at night and participate in illegal street races. But be careful - the cops are never asleep and they will chase you if they catch you breaking the law. You can also play as a cop and try to stop the racers. The open world mode is currently in alpha and will be improved with each new update.
 
If you prefer legal races, you can also join the tracks that are equipped for racing. These races are the best way to make some cash if you have the fastest car. You can use the money to buy new cars or parts, or to upgrade your existing ones.
