The book is now in its eighth edition, which was published in 2015 by Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. The eighth edition is updated with the latest research in the field and provides easy-to-understand, up-to-date coverage of how nutrition, energy transfer, and exercise training affect human performance. The book also features a vibrant, magazine-style design that makes the content more engaging and accessible, as well as chapter objectives, integrative questions, FYI sections, interviews with key figures in the field, practical sense features, figures and tables that clarify important concepts and information, and a free companion website that offers animations, references, and more[^1^].
 
The book is divided into seven parts: Part I introduces the basic concepts of exercise physiology; Part II explores the energy systems and bioenergetics of exercise; Part III examines the cardiovascular and respiratory responses to acute exercise; Part IV discusses the hormonal responses to exercise; Part V explains the body composition and weight control aspects of exercise; Part VI describes the nutrition and ergogenic aids for exercise performance; and Part VII covers the environmental influences on exercise performance.
 
The book is intended for students who are pursuing a degree or a career in exercise science, physical education, kinesiology, sports medicine, athletic training, physical therapy, or other health-related fields. The book is also a valuable resource for professionals who want to update their knowledge and skills in exercise physiology.
 
The book can be downloaded as a PDF file from various online sources[^2^] [^3^], but it is recommended to purchase a hard copy or an e-book version from the official publisher or other authorized sellers to support the authors and ensure the quality and accuracy of the content.
  
In this article, we will review some of the main topics and concepts covered in the book Exercise Physiology: Nutrition, Energy, and Human Performance by McArdle, Katch and Katch.
 
## Basic Concepts of Exercise Physiology
 
Exercise physiology is the study of how the human body functions and adapts to physical activity and exercise. Exercise physiology involves the integration of various disciplines, such as anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, biophysics, genetics, immunology, endocrinology, and psychology. Exercise physiology also applies the scientific method to investigate the acute and chronic effects of exercise on health and performance.
 
Some of the basic concepts of exercise physiology include:
 
- The definition and classification of physical activity, exercise, and physical fitness.
- The principles of training and adaptation, such as overload, specificity, reversibility, individuality, and variation.
- The methods of measuring and evaluating physical fitness, such as maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), lactate threshold, heart rate reserve, metabolic equivalent (MET), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and functional movement screen (FMS).
- The factors that influence exercise performance, such as genetics, age, sex, ethnicity, body size and shape, muscle fiber type, motivation, skill, and environment.
- The ethical and professional issues in exercise physiology research and practice, such as informed consent, confidentiality, safety, validity, reliability, and plagiarism.

## Energy Systems and Bioenergetics of Exercise
 
Energy systems and bioenergetics are the processes that provide the energy for muscle contraction and other cellular functions during exercise. Energy systems are classified into three types: phosphagen system (ATP-PCr system), glycolytic system (anaerobic glycolysis), and oxidative system (aerobic metabolism). Each system has different characteristics in terms of energy yield, duration, intensity, substrate utilization, by-products, and fatigue.

Some of the topics related to energy systems and bioenergetics include:

- The structure and function of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the universal energy currency of the cell.
- The role of creatine phosphate (PCr) in replenishing ATP during high-intensity exercise.
- The breakdown of glucose (glycolysis) and glycogen (glycogenolysis) to produce ATP in the absence of oxygen.
- The production of lactate (lactic acid) as a by-product of anaerobic glycolysis and its effects on muscle pH and fatigue.
- The oxidation of glucose (glycolysis + Krebs cycle + electron transport chain), fatty acids (beta-oxidation + Krebs cycle + electron transport chain), and amino acids (deamination + Krebs cycle + electron transport chain) to produce ATP in the presence of oxygen.
- The regulation of energy metabolism by hormones (such as insulin, glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine), enzymes (such as hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase), and feedback mechanisms (such as ATP/ADP ratio).
