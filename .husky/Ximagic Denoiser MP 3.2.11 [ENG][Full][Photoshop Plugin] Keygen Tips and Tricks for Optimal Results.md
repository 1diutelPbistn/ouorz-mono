- Median: A filter that replaces each pixel with the median value of its neighboring pixels. It is good for salt and pepper noise.
- Gauss: A filter that applies a Gaussian blur to the image. It is good for general noise reduction.
- DWT: A filter that uses overcomplete wavelets to decompose the image and filter it. It gives a good balance between smoothing and edge preservation.
- CWT: A filter that uses complex wavelets to decompose the image and filter it. It is similar to DWT but more robust to noise.
- DCT: A filter that uses discrete cosine transform to decompose the image and filter it. It is similar to DWT but faster.
- NLM: A filter that uses non-local means to compare each pixel with similar pixels in a large neighborhood and average them. It is good for medium/low noise images and can also remove defects and scratches.
- Non-linear diffusion: A filter that uses anisotropic diffusion to smooth the image based on the local gradient and curvature. It is good for medical images.
