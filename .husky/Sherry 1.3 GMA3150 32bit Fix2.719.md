## What is GMA 3150 and why does it need a better driver?
 
GMA 3150 is an integrated graphics card that is part of the Intel Atom N4xx and N5xx processors. It was designed for low-power and low-cost devices, such as netbooks, tablets and embedded systems. It supports DirectX 9.0c, Shader Model 2.0 and OpenGL 1.4.
 
However, GMA 3150 has some limitations and drawbacks that affect its performance and compatibility. For example, it does not support hardware TnL (Transform and Lighting), which is a feature that improves the rendering of 3D graphics. It also has a low clock speed, a small amount of video memory and a low bandwidth. These factors make GMA 3150 struggle with some games and applications that require more graphics power.
 
The default driver that comes with GMA 3150 is also not very optimized or updated. It does not support some features that are available on newer Intel graphics cards, such as WebGL, HTML5 acceleration and H.264 decoding.
