1. GM Discussion: The first step is to talk to your Game Master (GM), the person who runs the game and sets the scene for the players. The GM will tell you what kind of setting and genre you will be playing in, how many points you have to create your character, and any other rules or guidelines you need to follow.
2. Character Outline: The next step is to come up with a general idea of who your character is and what they can do. You can use any source of inspiration, such as anime, manga, movies, books, or your own imagination. You can also use one of the sample characters or templates provided in the BESM book or expansions. You should think about your character's name, age, appearance, personality, background, goals, and motivations.
3. Assign Stats: The third step is to assign numerical values to your character's three basic stats: Body, Mind, and Soul. These stats represent your character's physical, mental, and spiritual abilities. You can distribute your points among these stats as you wish, but each stat must have at least one point. The higher the stat, the better your character is at tasks related to that stat.
4. Character Attributes: The fourth step is to choose attributes for your character. Attributes are special abilities or traits that make your character unique and powerful. They can be anything from superpowers and magic to skills and equipment. There are dozens of attributes to choose from in the BESM book and expansions, each with its own cost and effect. You can also create your own attributes with the GM's approval.
5. Character Defects: The fifth step is to choose defects for your character. Defects are weaknesses or drawbacks that make your character vulnerable or flawed. They can be anything from enemies and curses to phobias and quirks. There are many defects to choose from in the BESM book and expansions, each with its own benefit and penalty. You can also create your own defects with the GM's approval.
6. Skill Selection: The final step is to select skills for your character. Skills are areas of knowledge or expertise that your character has learned or practiced. They can be anything from languages and professions to hobbies and sports. There are hundreds of skills to choose from in the BESM book and expansions, each with its own level and cost. You can also create your own skills with the GM's approval.

Once you have completed these steps, you have created your BESM character! You can now use them to play in any adventure or scenario that the GM has prepared for you and your fellow players. Have fun!
